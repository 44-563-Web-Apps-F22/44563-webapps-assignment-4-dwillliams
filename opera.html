            <p> ALEX.             But stay, my father is not here!

                ALINE.            And pray where is my mother dear?
              
                MR. WELLS.        I did not think it meet to see
                                  A dame of lengthy pedigree,
                                  A Baronet and K.C.B.
                                  A Doctor of Divinity,
                                  And that respectable Q.C.,
                                  All fast asleep, al-fresco-ly,
                                  And so I had them taken home
                                  And put to bed respectably!
                                  I trust my conduct meets your approbation.
              
                ALEX.             Sir, you have acted with discrimination,
                                  And shown more delicate appreciation
                                  Than we expect of persons of your station.
              
                MR. WELLS.        But stay—they waken one by one —
                                  The spell has worked—the deed is done!
                                  I would suggest that we retire
                                  While Love, the Housemaid, lights her kitchen
                                       fire!
              
                (Exeunt Mr. Wells, Alexis and Aline, on tiptoe, as the villagers
                stretch their arms, yawn, rub their eyes, and sit up.)
              
                MEN.        Why, where be oi, and what be oi a doin',
                                  A sleepin' out, just when the dews du rise?
                GIRLS.      Why, that's the very way your health to ruin,
                                  And don't seem quite respectable likewise!
                MEN. (staring at girls)      Eh, that's you!</p>
