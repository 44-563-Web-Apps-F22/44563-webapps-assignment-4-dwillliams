            <h2>The Sorcerer</h2>
            <h3>Act II Scene I</h3>
            <p> <h3>ALEX.</h3>             But stay, my father is not here!

                <h3>ALINE.</h3>            And pray where is my mother dear?
              
                <h3>MR. WELLS.</h3>        <p>I did not think it meet to see
                                  A dame of lengthy pedigree,
                                  A Baronet and K.C.B.
                                  A Doctor of Divinity,
                                  And that respectable Q.C.,
                                  All fast asleep, al-fresco-ly,
                                  And so I had them taken home
                                  And put to bed respectably!
                                  I trust my conduct meets your approbation.</p>
              
                <h3>ALEX.</h3>             <p>Sir, you have acted with discrimination,
                                  And shown more delicate appreciation
                                  Than we expect of persons of your station.</p>
              
                <h3>MR. WELLS.</h3>         <p>But stay—they waken one by one —
                                  The spell has worked—the deed is done!
                                  I would suggest that we retire
                                  While Love, the Housemaid, lights her kitchen
                                       fire!</p>
              
                <p>(Exeunt Mr. Wells, Alexis and Aline, on tiptoe, as the villagers
                stretch their arms, yawn, rub their eyes, and sit up.)</p>
              
                <h3>MEN.</h3>        <p>Why, where be oi, and what be oi a doin',
                                  A sleepin' out, just when the dews du rise?</p>
                <h3>GIRLS.</h3>      <p>Why, that's the very way your health to ruin,
                                  And don't seem quite respectable likewise!</p>
                <h3>MEN.</h3> <p>(staring at girls)</p>      <p>Eh, that's you!</p></p>
